The ICDM has always been a 'single stream' conference. There will be no traditional 'sessions' -- instead there will be stream of contributions in a sensible order. These proposed topics are just some labels that we might want to focus on.

It would be great if we could find a person that can introduce the proposed topic areas in a way that is suitable for a general crystallographic audience.

We have a great opportunity here to attract many 'structural analysts' -- researchers how work with crystal structures day in and day out, but may not be aware of the real advantages that Quantum Crystallography can bring to their work.
