Silvia is currently responsible of the Laue-in-Time-of-Flight single
crystal neutron diffraction instrument SXD at the ISIS Neutron and Muon
Source of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Oxford, UK).

After a Laurea in Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Milan (I)
and a Master in Polymer Science and Technology at the Polytechnic of
Milan (I), she obtained a PhD in Chemical Crystallography from the
University of Bern (CH). Since then, she worked at large scale
facilities like the ESRF (Swiss-Norwegian beamline BM1A and Material
science beamline ID11) and the ILL (single crystal neutron diffraction
instruments D19 and D10) in Grenoble (F). Her research interests
include: structure-properties relationship in molecular crystals,
effects of H/D isotope replacements on intermolecular interactions,
molecular motion and diffuse scattering in crystals, combining different
techniques *in-situ* (most recent: simultaneous Raman spectroscopy and
single crystal neutron diffraction for the study of thermo- and
photo-chromic materials).
