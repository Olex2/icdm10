Alessandro Genoni received his Ph.D. in Chemical Sciences from the University of Milan (Italy) in 2006. After two post-doctoral experiences (one in Kenneth M. Merz Jr.’s group at the “Quantum Theory Project” (QTP) of the University of Florida (USA), and another one in Giorgio Colombo’s group at the “Institute of Chemistry of Molecular Recognition” (ICRM) of the Italian CNR (Milan, Italy)), from October 2011 to June 2024 he was permeant CNRS researcher at the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics and Chemistry of the University of Lorraine (Metz & Nancy, France). Since July 2024 he has been Associate Professor at the Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering “Giulio Natta” of the “Politecnico di Milano” (Milan, Italy). His main research interests concern the extensions and the application of the X-ray restrained wave function approach as well as the development and application of new quantum chemistry methods, mainly based on extremely localized molecular orbitals.
