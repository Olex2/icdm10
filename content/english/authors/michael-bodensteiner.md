[Large Scale Facilities ](/topics/11_large-scale-facilities)

Michael Bodensteiner is Head of X-ray Structure Analysis at the Central Analytical Laboratory of the University of Regensburg. He studied chemistry at the University of Regensburg, where he obtained his PhD in inorganic chemistry in 2011. Since then he has been responsible for crystallography at the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy. His research focuses on improving crystal structure determination and extracting more information from it. He is particularly interested in quantum crystallography, anomalous dispersion and absorption effects, for which he spends a lot of time at the European Synchrotron.
