[Quantum Crystallography in Materials Science](/topics/03b_qcr-in-material-science)

Anna Krawczuk works at the interface of crystallography and quantum chemistry. Her work focuses on structureâ€“property relationships in molecular crystals, particularly in connection with optical properties. By combining experimental techniques like X-ray diffraction with theoretical methods, she aims to understand and accurately predict how subtle structural features influence macroscopic response of a material.
