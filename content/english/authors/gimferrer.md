Martí Gimferrer is a postdoctoral researcher at the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen. He studied chemistry at the University of Girona, where he obtained his PhD in chemistry in 2023. During those years, he performed multiple research stays at the Universität des Saarlandes and the University of California Berkeley. His research focuses on the development of computational methods for chemical bonding analysis. He is one of the lead developers in the APOST-3D code, a developer in the Q-Chem software (implementation of force decomposition analysis, and methods to elucidate oxidation states from wavefunction analysis), and is particularly interested in developing real-space atom-in-molecule definitions and applying chemical bonding tools in quantum crystallography.
