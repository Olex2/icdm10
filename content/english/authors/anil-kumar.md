Anil kumar is a postdoctoral researcher at the Electron Density Modelling Group in the
Department of Chemistry, University of Warsaw, Poland. Dr. Kumar earned his Ph.D. from Shiv
Nadar University, India, where his doctoral research provided deep insights into the electron
density distributions of polymorphic bioactive molecules. His current research is at the forefront
of applying 3D electron diffraction (MicroED) to organic crystals, particularly for intricate
charge density analysis. Dr. Kumar possesses extensive skills in 3D ED data collection,
processing, Dynamical and multipole refinement, alongside a robust background in crystal
structure determination and quantum chemical computations.
