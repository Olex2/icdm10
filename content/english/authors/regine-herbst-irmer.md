Regine Herbst-Irmer received her Ph.D under the supervision of George M. Sheldrick from the university of Göttingen in 1990. She stayed in his group until his retirement. Afterwards she joined the group of Dietmar Stalke. She works as a Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Göttingen. She is interested in the development of methods to improve data and model quality in X-ray crystallography in routine structure determinations (disorder, twins) and charge density investigations (anharmonic motion, TDS, validation).
