[Atomic Displacement: The big accumulator](/topics/10_atomic-displacement)


Anna Hoser completed her PhD at the Faculty of Chemistry, University of Warsaw, where her dissertation focused on methods for modelling hydrogen atoms during the refinement of experimental electron density measurements. She then worked as a postdoctoral researcher in [Professor Anders Ã˜. Madsen](/authors/anders-madsen)'s group at the Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, specializing in lattice dynamics and dynamic quantum crystallography. Currently, she is based at her alma mater, the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Warsaw, where she leads a research group dedicated to developing new methods for treating thermal motion in quantum crystallography and exploring ways to extract thermodynamic properties from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data.
