# In Durham

To get from the station to Collingwood College, you can either walk (~25 minutes) or take a taxi. There are also bus connections â€“ please use Google Maps to find the best route when you arrive.

Durham is a very small town, and the conferenceaccomodation is at [Collingwood College](https://www.durham.ac.uk/colleges-and-student-experience/colleges/collingwood/), which is located on the outskirts of the city. The college is a 20-minute walk from the city centre, and there are also buses that run frequently.

> The conference venue is the **Old Business School on Mill Hill Lane**, which is a 10-minute walk from Collingwood College, and not the New Business School, which is in the city centre!


Getting about by foot is safe and easy, and the city is very walkable -- and the walk along the river offers stunning views of the cathedral.
