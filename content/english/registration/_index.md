# In Durham

To get from the station to Collingwood college, you can either walk (~25 mintues) or take a taxi. There are also bus connections -- please ask Google for the best route when you get there.

Durham is a very small town, and the conference will be held at [Collingwood College](https://www.durham.ac.uk/colleges-and-student-experience/colleges/collingwood/), which is located on the outskirts of the city. The college is a 20-minute walk from the city centre, and there are also buses that run frequently.

Getting about by foot is safe and easy, and the city is very walkable -- and the walk along the river offers stunning views of the cathedral.
