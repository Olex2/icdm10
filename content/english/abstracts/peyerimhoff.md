The effect of resonant scattering is particularly significant if the energy of the incoming X-ray beam
is close to the natural vibration energies (absorption edges) of some atomic electrons. Mathematically, this requires
to add correction parameters f' + i f'' to the form factors f_0 for each atom. These correction parameters
depend on the atom and the energy of the incoming X-ray beam. While it is generally assumed that their angular dependence
can be neglected, our aim is to develop a quantitative theoretical evaluation of this assumption. In this 
talk, I will present Hoenl's theory which allows to include this angle dependency and report on our joint work with Florian Kleemiss
on such a quantitative theoretical evaluation.
