Polymorphism, i.e., the ability of a molecule to possess diverse spatial arrangements in crystalline form [1], can lead to the exhibition of distinct properties [2]. However, a strategic design of multifunctional materials with targeted applications necessitates  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  structure-property  relationships,  which  is  achievable  via  a  quantum crystallography  approach  [3].  Organic  molecules  comprising  keto-enol  and  enamine-imine  are  known  to  exhibit ferroelectricity  (FE)  in  their  crystalline  form  through  a cooperative  proton  tautomerism  mechanism  (PTM)  [2,4].

Recently,  some  of  us  have  explored  FE  in  the  polymorphic crystal  of  an  enamine-imine-based  organic  compound,  2-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole(1), which exhibits trimorphs [5]. While two forms crystallize in a polar space group (P41 and Pca21) (Figure 1), the third form crystallizes in a centrosymmetric space group (I41/a). The P41 form exhibits notable FE at room temperature, but the  Pca21 form  fails  to  exhibit  notable  FE.  Here,  we  employed multipolar  analysis  [6]  of  electron  densities  derived  using high-resolution  X-ray  diffraction  data and  periodic calculation-based dynamic structure factors to understand the variation  of  electronic  distributions  between  the  two  polar forms.
Further, we estimated the energy barrier for the proton hopping  in  both  forms  based  on  first-principles  calculations. Furthermore,  we  calculated  sublattice  polarisations  to  support  the  mechanism  behind  their  distinct  FE  properties.  Our study  demonstrates  that  the  quantum  crystallographic  approach  can  not  only  provide  deeper  insights  into  the  role  of molecular packing and intermolecular interactions in dictating physical properties, but it is also a useful tool for designing futuristic materials.
