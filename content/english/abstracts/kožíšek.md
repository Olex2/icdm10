Thanks to the continuous improvement of single-crystal X-ray diffractometers and data processing software, it is expected that experimental electronic structures are approaching reality. However, we still see certain differences between experimental and theoretical results. The question arises as to which results are more correct. For the accuracy of the experimental study, we have certain parameters available, such as the crystallographic R-factor, residual electron density, error analysis using the fractal analysis [1], or the comparison of measured and calculated structural factors.

Chemical intuition plays an important role. In coordination compounds of Cu(II) complexes with the d9 electron configuration, the maximum number of electrons in each d-orbital cannot exceed value of 2.0, as we have shown in tetra­kis(μ2-acetato)di­aquadicopper(II) complex [2]. We have also shown the interaction of dz2 - dz2 orbitals. The same interaction we have studied in 1,10-phenanthroline-salicylatopalladium(II)  monohydrate complex [3] (**Figure 1a,1b**).  Another example of chemical intuition will be shown in [4-methyl-3-[(tetra­hydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)­oxy]thia­zole-2(3H)-thione [4].](https://journals.iucr.org/b/issues/2020/03/00/px5018/index.html)
