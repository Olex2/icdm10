It is well known that alkali and alkaline earth elements undergo a
series of structural transformations under compression, typically
progressing from cubic phases to exotic complex frameworks and even to
incommensurate structures. Notably, sodium transforms into a wide band
gap insulator at extremely high pressures. In addition, the melting
behaviour of Group I and II elemental solids deviates significantly from
that of most materials, for which the melting temperature generally
increases with pressure. In contrast, these elements exhibit a
non-monotonic melting curve: the melting temperature initially rises,
then decreases to a minimum, and subsequently increases again. The
underlying mechanisms and electronic origins of these anomalous
behaviours remain incompletely understood.

One distinctive feature of compressed alkali and alkaline earth elements
is the presence of non-nuclear maxima (NNMs)—regions of localized
electron density in the interstitial spaces of the structure, often
associated with electride behaviour. From a chemical standpoint, this
phenomenon arises from the hybridization of valence orbitals with
unoccupied orbitals of higher angular momentum. In this study, the
characteristics of NNMs are examined using Bader’s Quantum Theory of
Atoms in Molecules. The analysis reveals that NNMs are pivotal in
stabilizing the crystalline structure. Moreover, the average electron
population associated with NNMs correlates with the relative densities
of the solid and liquid phases. It is a key parameter in determining the
melting trend of these elements.
