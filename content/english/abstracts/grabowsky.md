In my presentation, I will give a short introduction into techniques for chemical-bonding analysis from single-crystal
diffraction data (multipole modeling, X-ray wavefunction refinement) and into quantum-chemical methods for deriving
bonding descriptors (complementary bonding analysis). Afterwards, I will present some examples from the research of my
group and of others that I believe are perfect cases to show the usefulness of bonding analysis. I will also outline to which
extent the experimental diffraction data can enrich the information contents beyond purely theoretical calculations.
