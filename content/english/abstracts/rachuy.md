summary: In 2021 Stalke et al. analysed several tetrahedral distorted Co2+ complexes and predicted that a bite angle between 76-78° maximises the magnetic anisotropy, as it minimises the energy gap between the dxy and dx2-y2 orbital. The closer the orbitals are in energy, the larger is the magnetic anisotropy

In 2021 Stalke et al. analysed several tetrahedral distorted
Co<sup>2+</sup> complexes and predicted that a bite angle between 76-78°
maximises the magnetic anisotropy, as it minimises the energy gap
between the d<sub>xy</sub> and d<sub>x2-y2</sub> orbital. The closer the
orbitals are in energy, the larger is the magnetic anisotropy\[1\].
Overgaard et al. predicted an energy barrier U<sub>eff</sub> of
342 cm<sup>‑1</sup> for the case of the d<sub>xy</sub> and
d<sub>x2-y2</sub> orbital being degenerated \[2,3\]. In the present
study, two complexes with significant magnetic anisotropy,
Co{(N<sup>t</sup>Bu)<sub>2</sub>SPh}<sub>2</sub> and
Co{(N(tms))<sub>2</sub>SPh}<sub>2</sub>, were subjected to charge
density investigations based on high-resolution X-ray diffraction data,
to achieve a better insight into their magnetic properties especially
through the d-orbital population. Further on, we did calculations
\[4,5\] on the complexes and obtained from that d-orbital populations as
well, to validate and interpret the experimental results.
