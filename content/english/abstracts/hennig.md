Single crystal measurements at a synchrotron benefit from a slightly
focussed beam, a very high intensity and a freely tunable wavelength
\[1\]. Very small crystals can be measured, occasionally structures with
strong disorder can be solved and resonant effects can be investigated
\[2\]. On the other hand, some disadvantages should not remain
unmentioned, such as the fact that radiation damage can easily occur and
that the detector can easily become saturated due to high counting
rates. Excellent data can be obtained if these problems are taken into
consideration during the planning and conduction of the measurement.

We would like to present the current status of the diffractometer at the
Rossendorf Beamline (ROBL, BM20) at ESRF and how we do single crystal
diffraction. The diffractometer consists of a heavy optical bench with
an exchangeable Huber kappa goniometer and a Pilatus3 X 2M detector. It
is used for single crystal diffraction, in situ or operando powder
measurements and Grazing Incidence diffraction. The diffractometer is
controlled with the Pylatus software \[3\]. The single crystal data
extraction is performed with Crysis \[3\] and CrysAlisPro \[4\]. A Si
drift detector can be placed in different positions to combine
diffraction with XRF and XAS measurements. Devices for non-ambient
sample conditions are a LN2 cryostream (90-400K), a hot-air blower
(RT-1100K), a heating chamber (RT-1470K) \[1\].
