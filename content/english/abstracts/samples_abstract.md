The abstract submission is independent of the registration process -- and we apologise for the 'duplication' of information that is required for the purpose of generating your abstract.

The abstract submission page is a Google form that does not require logging in. You can provide your abstract in the markdown language to render your abstract automatically.

{{< button label="Submit Abstract" link="https://forms.gle/7C9k4Fwdsqqf8N3PA" style="solid" >}}

If you would rather send us an abstract in MS-Word or as a PDF, then this is also possible -- please send your abstract to info@icdm10.org.
