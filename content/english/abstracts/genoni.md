Today, the X-ray restrained wavefunction (XRW) method (also known as X-ray constrained wavefunction (XCW) approach) stands as one of the cornerstone techniques in modern quantum crystallography [1]. First introduced by Dylan Jayatilaka in 1998 [2], the strategy has undergone a steady and continuous methodological development over the years and has been fruitfully exploited to shed light on many chemical or physical problems and phenomena [3].

In terms of methodological progress, although the approach was initially formulated within the Hartree–Fock framework [2, 4], it has been gradually integrated with a broad range of quantum chemical techniques, including relativistic methods [5] and multi-determinant strategies within the valence bond theory of chemical bonding [6].

In terms of applications, the XRW technique has significantly advanced our understanding of chemical bonding, even allowing for the re-evaluation of classical concepts such as hypervalency [7]. It has also been used to investigate optoelectronic properties in systems with significant nonlinear optical activity [8], as well as to explore biologically and pharmaceutically relevant compounds [9]. Notably, the method has also demonstrated the ability to capture electron correlation and polarization effects on the electron density [10, 11].

This introductory talk will provide a brief overview of the theoretical foundations of the XRW approach, followed by a summary of its key achievements. In the final part of the presentation, attention will turn to future research directions, with a particular focus on the potential of leveraging the Jayatilaka method for the development of novel exchange-correlation functionals in density functional theory [12].
