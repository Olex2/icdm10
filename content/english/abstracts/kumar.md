Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has emerged as a transformative technique in structural science, enabling crystallographic analysis of nanocrystals beyond the reach of traditional X-ray methods[1,2]. In this study, we present a detailed investigation of electron density distributions derived from 3D ED data, with emphasis on capturing subtle bonding features and charge localization. High-resolution electron diffraction data were collected for the L-alanine and urea molecules using a cryo-cooled TEM, followed by full multipole refinement using the Hansen–Coppens formalism within a dynamical scattering framework. The multipole model of experimental 3D ED data (e*MM*exp) was compared with the multipole models refined against theoretical (periodic DFT) static electron structure factors (e*MM*theo) and high-resolution experimental X-ray diffraction data (x*MM*exp). Our results show strong agreement across deformation density features, electrostatic potential distributions, and topological parameters derived via Bader’s Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM). Importantly, 3D ED enabled reliable refinement of hydrogen positions and anisotropic atomic displacement parameters — surpassing conventional limitations of X-ray-based methods. This study demonstrate that 3D ED enables precise charge density mapping in organic systems, establishing it as a robust tool for quantum crystallography and the study of materials, where conventional approaches fail due to crystal size or beam sensitivity.
