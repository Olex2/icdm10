Anisotropic displacement parameters usually do not attract attention and
are treated as a dustbin for all experimental errors (there are only few
remarkable exceptions). However, when data quality is good enough and we
enrich the analysis of thermal motion in crystals with information from
periodic DFT calculations, we can obtain hydrogen atoms ADPs and
accurate thermodynamic properties (heat capacity, entropy) for molecular
crystals, which are still difficult to obtain for purely from
theoretical calculations. In this contribution the normal mode
refinement (NoMoRe) approach \[1,2\]: current developments, applications
\[3,4\] and future directions will be presented.
