Crystallography has established a de-facto, well-understood, level of quality in its data over many decades. This is largely based on a long history of standardised instrumentation, generating curated and coherent databases, common data processing approaches, deriving and maintaining standards, and development of validation approaches. This has served us exceptionally well and our field is generally regarded as an exemplary discipline for generating and making available scientific data. This talk will outline our current ‘Quality (and Trust) Framework’ and then illustrate how it now desperately needs to be progressed again to account for new paradigm changing methods such as Quantum Crystallography and Electron Diffraction.
