This lecture will explore how combining electron diffraction with
quantum crystallography can reveal hidden details in molecular
structures. Using cryo-EM and three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D
ED), scientists can now create detailed maps of a molecule's
electrostatic potential. These maps show not only the positions of atoms
but also small differences in charge density that provide clues about
protonation, oxidation, and chemical bonding. Focusing on both complex
protein structures and small organic molecules, the lecture will explain
how adapting electron density models from X‑ray diffraction to
electron-based techniques can transform our understanding of molecular
interactions and structures on the nanoscale.
