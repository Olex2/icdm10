As a highly local probe of atomic environments, solid-state NMR is a
highly complementary tool to diffraction-based analysis. Traditionally
often limited to fingerprinting different solid forms, e.g. polymorphs,
amorphous vs. crystalline forms, the field of “NMR
crystallography”\[1,2\] has developed as DFT calculations now allow NMR
spectra to be predicted efficiently from trial structures. NMR can then
be used to resolve questions of disorder or distinguishing between
alternative structural models\[3\]. In particular, the <sup>1</sup>H
chemical shift is extremely sensitive to position, allowing questions of
hydrogen positioning, e.g. salt vs. co-crystal forms to be readily
resolved.

A weakness of current NMR crystallography for organic solids is the
relatively poor positioning of H by independent atom modelling in XRD
refinement. In order to obtain reasonable agreement with NMR data, it is
essential to use DFT to optimise H positions in XRD-derived structures
prior to calculating NMR parameters, which introduces subtle systematic
errors. There is clear potential for more accurate structures provided
by quantum crystallography to provide better starting points for NMR
crystallography.

This talk will discuss other questions of common interests, such as the
effects of temperature on NMR parameters via vibrational modes, i.e.
dynamic NMR crystallography. These areas of overlap are especially
useful to explore as the UK Collaborative Computational Project in NMR
Crystallography\[4\], a key developer of tools for NMR crystallography,
plans its roadmap for future funding.
