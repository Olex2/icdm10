The determination of the actual charge distribution around atoms remains
a central challenge in modern quantum crystallography. Currently, the
only ways to probe this phenomenon involve either high-resolution,
time-consuming X-ray diffraction experiments or complementary techniques
such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

Traditionally, anomalous dispersion parameters *f′* and *f′′* are
treated as fixed constants derived for isolated, neutral atoms [1],
and are used during crystal structure refinement. However, this
simplification fails to reflect the true chemical environment of atoms,
potentially leading to misinterpretation of data and inaccurate
structure models. Anomalous Dispersion Refinement (ADR) offers a
promising alternative: it enables the refinement of *f′* and *f′′*
directly from standard X-ray diffraction data, potentially allowing
these parameters to reflect the formal oxidation states of atoms without
the need for additional analytical techniques [2]. Moreover, ADR has
been shown to improve structure models not only in experiments conducted
near absorption edges, but also in measurements carried out far from
these edges on standard in-house diffractometers [3].

This study investigates whether ADR can reflect actual “oxidation
states” of gold atoms in X-ray crystallographic models. To test this
approach, we selected isomers of
*1-(pyren-1-yl)-prop-2-yn-1-onyl-(triethylphosphine)-gold(I),* which
contain gold atoms in chemically distinct environments within the same
compound. This choice enables meaningful comparisons without the
confounding effects of varying substituents. Initial results for the
epsilon and alpha isomers—differing mainly in the type of inter-gold
interactions (the epsilon isomer forms dimers, while the alpha isomer
contains four distinct gold sites; see Figure 1)—demonstrate that these
structural differences are reflected in the refined anomalous dispersion
parameters.
