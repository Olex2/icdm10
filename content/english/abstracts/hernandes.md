[n]cumulenes are unsaturated linear hydrocarbons which possess "n" continuous C=C double bonds and “n+1” carbon atoms. This unique characteristic makes them promising candidates for applications, such as: molecular wires, nonlinear optical materials and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).  However, the  particular  π  electronic  structure of  [n]cumulenes  varies according  to their terminal  functional  groups  and  also  if  the  number  of  cumulated  double bonds is even or odd.

Therefore, a set of QTAIM calculations were conducted to shed light on the nature of bonds in even and odd cumulated systems, with n = 3, 4, 5 and 6, functionalized with alkyls, aryls and  N-heterocyclic  carbenes  (NHCs).  Through  these  calculations,  variations  in  the delocalization indexes and in the values of the Laplacian of the electron density at the critical point  of  the  bonds  present  in  the  cumulenic  chain  were  obtained.  Noteworthy,  the  most outstanding changes were observed on the ellipticity of the even systems functionalized with NHCs. Finally, the results were compared with polyynes and polyenes, because they are also conjugated hydrocarbons, structurally similar but more widely studied.
