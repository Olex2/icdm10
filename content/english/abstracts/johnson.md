We present a combined experimental and density functional theory study that characterizes the charge and spin density in Ni*X*<sub>2</sub>(3,5-lutidine)4 (*X* = Cl, Br and I). In this material, magnetic exchange interactions occur via Ni<sup>2+</sup>–halide … halide–Ni<sup>2+</sup> pathways, forming one-dimensional chains. We find evidence for weak halide…halide covalency in the iodine system, which is greatly reduced when *X* = Br and is absent for *X* = Cl; this is consistent with the reported ‘switching-on’ of magnetic exchange in the larger-halide cases. Our results are benchmarked against density functional theory calculations on [NiHF<sub>2</sub>-(pyrazine)2]SbF<sub>6</sub>, in which the primary magnetic exchange is mediated by F–H–F bridging ligands. This comparison indicates that, despite the largely depleted charge density found at the centre of halide…halide bonds, these through-space interactions can support strong magnetic exchange gated by weak covalency and enhanced by significant electron density overlapping that of the transition metal centres [1].
