Over the past decade, electron crystallography has emerged as a
prominent technique within the crystallographic research community
\[1\], enabling structural characterisation at the nanoscale and
advancing new areas of structural investigation. This method is
generating a growing interest within the charge density research
community.

Charge density research and electron diffraction share a
well-established historical connection. This presentation provides a
concise overview of various electron diffraction and microscopy
techniques capable of yielding valuable charge density information,
along with important considerations regarding sample size requirements
and dynamical scattering effects.

Regarding 3D electron diffraction (3DED), this discussion will examine
critical aspects of the data processing pipeline and identify areas
requiring special attention when utilizing electron diffraction data for
charge density studies.
