|:-----------:|
|This session explores the use of quantum crystallography to investigate structure-property relationships in crystalline materials. By providing detailed insights into the directionality, anisotropy, and strength of intermolecular interactions, these techniques enable the fine-tuning of selected physical properties. We welcome abstracts presenting studies that highlight the role of quantum crystallography in understanding and designing crystalline phases with tailored properties.|
